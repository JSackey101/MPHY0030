# Supported development environment for Python

## Operating system
- Linux is supported, such as Ubuntu and Debian.
- Windows is supported with [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10). Follow the link to install either WSL 1 or 2, to get an Linux Terminal (if unsure, choose any version of Ubuntu).
>**Note:** Developing Python natively on Windows is also popular, for example, using [Microsoft Store app Python](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/python/beginners). However, technical support will not be available from this module.
- Chrome OS is supported with its [Linux turned on](https://support.google.com/chromebook/answer/9145439).
- MacOS is partially supported on its Terminal.


## Virtual environment
For tutorials and coursework, external libraries and packages will be useful. There are numerous ways to manage your development environment. This module recommended to use Miniconda or its superset Anaconda.
- [Install Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/).


## Install Visual Studio Code
There are many IDEs or powerful code editors suportting Python. Technical support is available for Visual Studio Code.  
- Install [Microsoft Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) by following the relevant instruction in the link.  
>**Note:** For working on WSL on Windows, you may need to add [remote development extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/wsl).

- Add the [Python extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python). This can be done in the VSC Extensions (Ctrl+Shift+X).


## Go through an example
For example, you can find a step-by-step [tutorial in the VSC documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial).

## Tutorials
To get started with Python, it is recommended to go through at least one of the following options, for what is needed in this module.
