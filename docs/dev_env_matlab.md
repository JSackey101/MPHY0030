## Operating system
- MATLAB is a cross-platform application, which can be installed on almost all major operating systems, Linux, Windows, MacOS and Chrome OS (within its Linux).  
- MATLAB is available for all UCL students. You can obtain a license at [UCL Software Database](https://swdb.ucl.ac.uk/) or [Desktop@UCL Anywhere](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/isd/services/computers/remote-access/desktopucl-anywhere). 
- Please [contact UCL ISD for help and further support](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/isd/help-support).


## Documentation
MATLAB has one of the elaborated and well-written documentations in the world of technical computing. It is not only the best place to learn and search for the usages of the MATLAB programming language and the numerical tools, but a rich source of computing knowledge and scientific accuracy.
- The [online MATLAB Documentation](https://uk.mathworks.com/help/matlab/).

- [Get started with MATLAB](https://uk.mathworks.com/help/matlab/getting-started-with-matlab.html) is recommended for this module.
