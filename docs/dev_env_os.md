# Supported development environment in different operating systems

Windows is supported with [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10). Follow the link to install either WSL 1 or 2, to get an Linux Terminal (if unsure, choose any version of Ubuntu). You can access your Windows files at `/mnt`, often `/mnt/c`.

On linux, there are a number of basic Unix-like commands to get you navigate and perform file operations, copy, move, cerate new folder etc. There is a tutorial in the [Ubuntu documentation](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/command-line-for-beginners#1-overview), among many others you can find online.
